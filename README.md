One of the most serious and alarming problems that humanity is currently facing is the declining quality of natural water resources including lakes, streams, and estuaries. Every element of life is impacted by the wide-ranging effects of dirty water. Hence, it is essential to manage water resources if we want to maximize the quality of our water. If data are studied and water quality is anticipated ahead, the impacts of water contamination can be effectively addressed. Many earlier studies have addressed this topic, but more has to be done to improve the usefulness, effectiveness, and reliability of the present water quality management approaches.The objective of this research is to create a water quality prediction model utilizing machine learning models and water quality parameters.
