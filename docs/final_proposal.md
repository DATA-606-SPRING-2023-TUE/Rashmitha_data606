# Water Quality Predection
Water quality parameters include chemical, physical, and biological properties and can be tested or monitored based on the desired water parameters of concern. Parameters that are frequently sampled or monitored for water quality include temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, ORP, and turbidity. However water monitoring may also include measuring total algae, ISEs (ammonia, nitrate, chloride), or laboratory parameters such as BOD, titration, or TOC

## Explainning the project
putting machine learning methods to use to build a prediction of water quality. Using some factors, such as the Ph level, conductivity, hardness, etc., this technique forecasts if the water is fine to consume or not.
## About Data
The dataset considered for this project is taken from Kaggle dataset. Link is given below
https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability

Dataset consists of 3276 records with 10 column of which 9 are input variables and 'potability' is the output variable.

ppm: parts per million
μg/L: microgram per litre
mg/L: milligram per litre

Column description:

1. ph: pH of 1. water (0 to 14).
2. Hardness: Capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L.
3. Solids: Total dissolved solids in ppm.
4. Chloramines: Amount of Chloramines in ppm.
5. Sulfate: Amount of Sulfates dissolved in mg/L.
6. Conductivity: Electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm.
7. Organic_carbon: Amount of organic carbon in ppm.
8. Trihalomethanes: Amount of Trihalomethanes in μg/L.
9. Turbidity: Measure of light emiting property of water in NTU.
10. Potability: Indicates if water is safe for human consumption. Potable is 1 and not potable is 0.
